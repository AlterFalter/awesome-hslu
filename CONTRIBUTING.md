# Contribution Guidelines
Follow these guidelines and your pull request should be accepted.

## Consistency
Keep the document consistent. Don't introduce new ways of formatting etc.

## Modules
1. When adding an new module, make an entry in the *table of contents* at the correct position (alphabetical order).
2. Add a new section to the document (again, alphabetical order).
3. The title of the section shall be the short name of the module.
4. A description of the module (e.g. the full name) shall be provided underneath the title.

## Links
1. If you add a new link to one of the modules, add it to the correct semester. In case you don't know the semester, try to make a guess.
2. Use `user-name/repo-name` as the link description.
3. Links are ordered alphabetically within a semester.
4. Semesters are ordered top-down from latest to oldest.
